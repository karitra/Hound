 Hi there!

 It is a sample robot intended to help me get a (Perl) job (minor aim is to gain some practice). It's just a silly experement, some practical self-inspired task and nothing more. Please don't treat it very serious.

 To run it you need network access + installed Perl modules: 

   LWP::Simple
   YAML::Simple
   MIME::Lite

 Also support for features - /state say/ is required, but can be easly avoided.

 Command line parameters:

 your_shell> jpl.pl <mailbox username> <mailbox password>

 Enjoy it (if you still able to enjoy)!
